# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

The goal is to analyze and predict the demand of rented bikes. The dataset contains 8,760 observations with 14 columns containing both categorical and numeric/non-categorical data.

## 1. Problem statement
Rental bikes are presented in numerous metropolitan cities to improve portability. It is essential to make rental bikes accessible and open to people as it reduces the waiting time. Ultimately, fulfilling the demand of the city with a stable stock of rental bikes becomes the main issue. So it becomes crucial to predict the bike count expected every hour for the steady inventory of rental bikes.
